## Requirement Analysis
### Reasoning
Based on the provided requirements and data, I'll create a comprehensive implementation plan that:
1. Analyzes the CSV data structure and database schema requirements
2. Plans the FastAPI backend with necessary endpoints
3. Designs the NextJS frontend with required components
4. Includes data validation and computation logic for yearly volumes and durations
5. Incorporates file upload functionality for documentation
6. Ensures proper data type handling for all fields

### Analysis Results
1. Data Structure Analysis:
   - The system needs to handle 12 main fields as per Process_DB_Datatypes.md
   - Several fields require ENUM validation (Department, Apps Used, Frequency, Process Status)
   - Computed fields need backend logic (Yearly Volume, Yearly Duration)
   - Documentation field needs file handling capabilities

2. Key Requirements:
   - CRUD operations for process management
   - Data validation for email, time formats, and enums
   - File upload system for documentation
   - Computed field calculations
   - Frontend data display and management interface

3. Technical Considerations:
   - SQLite database for data storage. Use process.db in our case.
   - FastAPI for backend API development
   - NextJS for frontend development. Refer to screenshot in the task.
   - File storage system for documentation
   - Data validation and computation logic
   - User interface for data management

## Implementation Plan
### Reasoning
The provided requirements outline a comprehensive system for process management with data handling, computation, and file storage capabilities. The implementation needs to be broken down into manageable components:

1. The backend requires FastAPI setup with proper database models, schemas, and endpoints for CRUD operations and file handling.
2. The frontend needs NextJS components for data display, form handling, and file uploads.
3. Data validation and computation logic must be implemented for specific fields.
4. File storage system needs to be integrated for documentation handling.

### Plan Details
1. Backend Setup
```python
# backend/main.py (Lines 1-50)
- Set up FastAPI application with CORS
- Configure database connection
- Create base models and schemas

# backend/models.py (Lines 1-100)
- Define SQLAlchemy models for Process
- Implement validation for ENUM fields
- Create computed field logic

# backend/schemas.py (Lines 1-80)
- Define Pydantic schemas for request/response models
- Implement validation logic
```

2. API Endpoints (3-4 hours)
```python
# backend/main.py (Lines 51-200)
- POST /upload-csv: CSV file upload and processing
- GET /processes: Retrieve all processes
- POST /process: Create new process
- PUT /process/{id}: Update existing process
- DELETE /process/{id}: Delete process
- GET /process/{id}: Get single process
```

3. Frontend Setup (2-3 hours)
```typescript
# frontend/app/page.tsx (Lines 1-50)
- Set up main layout
- Configure API client
- Implement React Query setup

# frontend/components/Layout.tsx (Lines 1-40)

- Implement progress indicator
- Add validation feedback

# frontend/components/ProcessForm.tsx (Lines 1-200)
- Create form for process creation/editing
- Implement field validation
- Add computed field display
```

5. Data Handling and Validation (2-3 hours)
```python
# backend/utils.py (Lines 1-100)
- Implement CSV parsing logic
- Create validation functions
- Add computation helpers

# frontend/utils/validation.ts (Lines 1-50)

- Implement computation helpers
```

6. Testing and Documentation (2-1 hours)
```python
# backend/tests/test_api.py (Lines 1-150)
- Write API endpoint tests

- Test computation logic

# docs/API.md (Lines 1-100)
- Document API endpoints
- Add usage examples
- Include setup instructions
```
